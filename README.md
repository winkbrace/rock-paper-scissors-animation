# Rock, Paper, Scissors simulation

This was a fun javascript experiment to simulate a large group of nodes battling each other 
on rock, paper, scissors. I used colors to make it visually appealing.

To get a nice Perlin noise start instead of a complete random start, 
I used [josephg/noisejs](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs).

### Run

Simply open index.html to run the simulation.

### Tweak

You can play around with the values at the top of script.js to increase variables like cell size, speed and colors.
